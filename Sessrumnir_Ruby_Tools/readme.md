## Sessrúmnir Ruby

These are bits of ruby code I have made and want to save. Partially for practice, partially to keep up an algorithmic edge. As an experiment, I am moving to make them interact as a sort of horribly arranged library.

Sessrúmnir was Freyja's mead hall located in Fólkvangr, a sort of opposition to Valhalla.
