========

This is a collection of code I reuse/random coding projects that I do not want to take up a whole repo with

###This repo contains:

1. A collection of dotfiles including my bash aliases for my local machine
2. Some JS functions I have written and saved for reuse, but mostly just to explore more about JS
3. A Ruby Battleship console game I created long ago and am now rewriting from the ground up with my current knowledge (The new version does not yet work)
4. A set up Ruby Benchmarking suite
5. Sessrumnir: Ruby bits of code that I have saved. The code to help with math solutions mostly was inspired by project euler.
6. A customized Sinatra Rake File (Basic rake experimentation, not touched since before I learned Rails)
