Dotfiles
========

####This is a custom bash environment

The .bash_profle here is a copy of the actual one in the user directory. Notice it sources the other files from their directory. This way the dotfiles can stay in this repo.


- /aliases contains .aliases.sh, which is generated by some experimental ruby code 'chamberlain' which takes yaml files and converts thme to bash. All aliases echo the original command before being run, to help remind what the real command is

- .bare_bones contains the most basic versions

- .serv is an ongoing project of bash scripts I want in my servers
