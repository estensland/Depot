####This is a custom bash environment

The .bash_profle here is a copy of the actual one in the user directory. Notice it sources the other files from their directory.

- .bare_bones is a file thrown together of things I have grown dependent on

- .aliases contains different files for bundler, git, heroku, homebrew, rails, and other aliases including custom ones, all in the name of increasing the speed of coding

- .bash-prompt customizes the display prompt (as the name suggests)

- The git files are for git versioning
