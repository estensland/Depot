####This is a custom bash environment

The .bash_profle here is a copy of the actual one in the user directory. Notice it sources the other files from their directory.


- /aliases contains different files for bundler, git, heroku, homebrew, rails, and other aliases including custom ones, all in the name of increasing the speed of coding

- .bare_bones contains bash alias that I am most dependent on

- .serv is an ongoing project of bash scripts I want in my servers
