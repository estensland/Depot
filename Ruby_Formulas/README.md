## Ruby Calculations

Bits of ruby code I have made and want to save. Partially for practice, partially to keep up an algorithmic edge

1. chance_distribution.rb -> Distribution case-statements, ie. Percent to Grade or RPG roll action
1. random_ruby_files.rb -> Non-sort junk
1. statistics_junk.rb -> Array Module for Mean, Mode, Median, etc
1. string_formatting.rb	-> Formatting numbers either to words or with commas
