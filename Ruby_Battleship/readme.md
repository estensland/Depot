### BATTLESHIP

I started this when I was learning to code and I thought it is time for a good refactoring. Then I opened it and realized it need more than good refactoring...it needed a ton of refactoring. Main issues (besides the least DRY code in the history of the world) is that the computer logic breaks down late in the game and keeps hitting squares again even though it has already hit them and other are still open.
