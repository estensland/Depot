#Object Oriented TypeScript

Basic object oriented approach in TypeScript as a prep to possible use it with Angular 2.0. For quick reference on how TypeScript works, compare westeros_sample/got.ts to it's compiled end westeros_sample/got.js

1. Westeros sample is some basic OOP with multiple classes and some inheritance.
2. Dom Manipulator is a theoretical class to add html to a page


###To Compile to JS


`npm install -g tsc`

`tsc {tsFile}` --out {jsFile}`
